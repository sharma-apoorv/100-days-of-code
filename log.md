# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Achievement**:

    * Used the MLlib and Pyspark library to cluster breast cancer data with K-means algorithm. 
    * This method achieved an accuracy of 85%.
    * Performed dimensionality-reduction using the PCA procedure.
    * Re-ran the K-means algorithm with the reduced data. 
      * There was no reduction in accuracy!
      * The algorithm was much faster to train

**Thoughts**:

**Key Learnings**:

    * The K-means algorithm uses the default of Euclidean distance by default
    * Dimensionality reduction allows K-means to run faster, without sacrificing accuracy!
